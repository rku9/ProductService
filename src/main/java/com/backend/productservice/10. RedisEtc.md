* We try to optimize the query processing time at the database level as we cannot remove the network call
  to the database in a distributed system. This would involve having the db in the server. 
* This would require us to have the db in all the servers which would increase the cost and costly SYNC
  problem.
* The database has to be differentiated from the server(Stateless).

* Another solution could be -> Instead of storing the whole DB inside the server, we can only store a few
  products in the server. But this could be only be optimized for a certain group of products and for a
  certain time period. We can store a map for those group of products and do a check before making a db
  call.
* This will be stored in the RAM. But we still won't be able to resolve the sync issue in case of the updates.


* **SOLUTION**
* To solve this sync issue we will need a common storage, and it has to be fast. This can be done using a
  common cache(Redis).
* This storing of the data in the cache has to be strategic. We cannot store just any data in the cache as
  it would fill the cache pretty quickly, and we have to make the db calls in case of cache miss.


* For implementation look at the fsProductService and follow the logic.
* We have to make the BaseModel implement the Serializable interface as by default the java objects are not
  serializable.
