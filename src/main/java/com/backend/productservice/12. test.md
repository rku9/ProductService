* Test case(unit) is a method that is used to test some functionality.
* 3A framework -> Arrange, Act and Assert. 
* Arranging is the hardcoding of the variables.
* Acting involves getting the actual value.
* Asserting is making sure that the value of the expected output is the same as the actual output. 
* There are different ways to assert. We can assert 2 values, null, timeout, throws(for some exception) etc.
* E.g. `assertTimeout(Duration.ofMillis(1000), ()->productRepository.findById(10));`
  *    `assertThrows(NoProductException.class, ()->productController.getSingleProduct(-1L));`

* ##### **Implementing the test cases**
* In the product controller test class we need the object of the product controller but to pass that through the 
  constructor, we need to create an object of this test class. To avoid this we can use @Autowired.
* Autowire requires the object that's going to be used to be actually present somewhere in the app when the 
  application will be started.
* But here we are not creating an object of the ProductController. For that we need to initialize the entire
  spring context.
* We can do that using @SpringBootTest.
