* **Authentication** is a concept using which a website will identify the user. Tell the website who you are.
* We need the credentials for this like email, password etc.
* We need to have a certain set of permissions to access some product from a provider along with the account.
* This is **Authorization**. It's an extra layer of permissions needed to access that functionality(e.g. admin access).
* We may be authenticated but not authorized.

* On Amazon, we would need neither authentication nor authorization.
* On a Movie Booking Platform , we would need Authentication to book the seat availability but not Authorization.
* To cancel a ticket, we would need both as we cannot cancel a seat we haven't booked. We must be authorized to do that.
